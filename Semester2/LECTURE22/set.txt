Sets are a type of associative container in which each element has to be unique because the value fo the elment identiesf it 
the values areelements folowing a specific


1.) sets are associative containers that store unique elemnets
following a specfid ordered

traversal using iterators

2.) Multisets are associative containers that store multipe elements having equivalent values follwing a specfic order.

by default set is ordered (sets or multiset both are ordered by default)
stores element in sorted orderit allows the storage of multiple elemnets
 we can erase more than 1 element by giving the start iterator and end iterator

we have to specify unordered

ordered_set: ordered set are associative containers that store unqiue elemnets in no particular order following are the propertof unordered set
elements can be stored in any order ( no sroted order)
stores only unique values
hash-table used to store elements
we can erase only the element for which the iterator position is given.

Not:all other properties are similar to the set.

4.) Unordered_multiset : Unordered_multiset is an associative container that contains a set of non-unique elements is unsorted order . following are the properof of unordered multiset.




sets are immutable

like other data structures
