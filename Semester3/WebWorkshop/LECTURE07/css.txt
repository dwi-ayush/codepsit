Here's a brief introduction to CSS:

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):

    Purpose: CSS is used to style and layout web pages. It controls the appearance of HTML elements.
    Syntax: CSS is made up of selectors (which element to style) and declarations (how to style it).
        Example: h1 { color: blue; font-size: 20px; }
        Selector: h1 (which element)
        Declaration block: { color: blue; font-size: 20px; }
    Types of CSS:
        Inline CSS: Written directly in the HTML element.
            Example: <p style="color:red;">Text</p>
        Internal CSS: Defined within the <style> tag in the HTML <head>.
            Example:

            html

        <style> p { color: green; } </style>

    External CSS: In a separate .css file, linked to the HTML.
        Example: <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

Cascading: CSS rules are applied in a cascading manner, with priority given to the most specific selectors.
