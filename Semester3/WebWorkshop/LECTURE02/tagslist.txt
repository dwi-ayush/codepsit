HTML list are used to specify list of information . all list may contain one or more list elements,

ORDERED LIST:

    In HTML, an ordered list is created using the `<ol>` tag. The default numbering is numeric, but different types of numbering can be specified using the `type` attribute. Here are the types of ordered lists:

1. Default Numeric List (1, 2, 3, ...) – This is the default behavior for an ordered list, where items are numbered sequentially.

2. type = "a" Lowercase Letters (a, b, c, ...) – You can specify this type for lists that need to use lowercase letters for numbering.

3. type = "A" Uppercase Letters (A, B, C, ...) – This type uses uppercase letters to number the list items.

4. type = "i" Lowercase Roman Numerals (i, ii, iii, ...) – This format uses lowercase Roman numerals to number the list items.

5. type = "I" Uppercase Roman Numerals (I, II, III, ...) – This format uses uppercase Roman numerals to number the list items.
