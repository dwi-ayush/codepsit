History of HTML
1991 HTML fisrt publiced 
1995 HTML 2.0
1997 HTML 3.2
1999 HTML 4.01
2000 XHTML 1.0
2002
2009
2012 HTML5
2014 HTML5.1

after HTML 4.01 was released, focus shifted to XHTML and its stricter standards.
XHTML 2.0 had very strict standards but was abandoned in 2009 in favor of HTML5.
HTML5 is much more tolerant and can handle markup from all the prior version. A working draft was released in 2012 and it is 
schdeduled to be finalized by the end of 2014

HTML5.1 is currectly under development and expected to be finalized in late 2016.

Goals of HTML5
Support all existing web pages. With HTML5, there is no requirement to go back and revise older webistes.
Reduce the need for external plugins and scripts to show website content.
Improve the semantic definition (i.e. meaning and purpose ) of page elements.
Make the rendering of web content universal and independent of the device being used 

New Elements in HTML5
<article> <figcaption> <progress>
<aside> <footer> <section>
<audio> <header> <source>
<canvas> <hgroup> <svg>
<datalist> <mark> <time>
<figure> <nav> <video>

these are just some of the new elements introduced in HTML5. We will be exploring each of these during this
course

Other new features in HTML5
-> Built-in audio and video support (without plugins)
-> Enhanced form controls and attributes
-> The Canvas ( a way to draw directly on a web page)
-> Drag and Drop functionality
-> Support for CSS3 (the newer and more powerful version of CSS)
-> More advanced features for web developers, such as data storage and offline applications.

First Look at HTML5
Remember the DOCTYPE declaration from XHTML and HTML?
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
"http://www.w3.org//TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" " http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">

In HTML5, there is just one possible DOCTYPE declaration and it is simpler:
<!DOCTYPE html>

which is just 15 characters!


This is what the <html> element looked like in XHTML:
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en" lang="en">
again, HTML5 simplifies this line:
<html lang = "en">

The lang attribute in the <html> element declares which lagnuage the page content is in.



Here is a typeical XHTML <head> section:
<head>
    <meta http-equiv="content-type" content = "text/html; charset = utf-8" />
    <title> My First XHTML Page</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css" />
</head>

And the HTML5 version:
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title> My First HTML5 Page</title>
    <link rel="style
