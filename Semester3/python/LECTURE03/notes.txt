List, Tuple, Set, Dictionary

Four built-in data structures in Python:-
list, tuple, set, Dictionary
-each having qualities and usage different from the other three.

List is a collection of items that is written with square brackets. It is mutable, ordered and allows duplicate members. Example: list = [1,2,3,'a','b',[3,5]]

Tuple is a collection of objects that is written with first brackets. It is immutable. 
Example: tuple = (2,1,10,4,7)

Set is a collection of elements that is written with curly brackets. It is unindexed and unordered.
Example: s = {x for x in 'abracadabra' if x not in 'abc'}

Dictionary is a collection which is ordered, changeable and does not allow duplicates.
It is written with curly brackets and objects are stored in key: value format.
Example : X = {1:'a', 2:'b' , 3:'sdflkj'}
