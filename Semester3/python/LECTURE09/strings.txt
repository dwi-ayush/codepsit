A string in Python is a sequence of characeters enclosed within single quotes ('...')
or double quotes ("..."). Strings are immutable, meaning once a string is created, its content cannot be 
changed


Creating Strings

-> Single-line strings: Use single or double quotes.
    -> string1 = 'Hello'
    -> string2 = "Python"
-> Multi-line strings: Use triple quotes("""...""") or ('''...''')
